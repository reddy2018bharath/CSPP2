 * In the previous module you have created List ADT.
 * ADTs are developed as reusable libraries
 * i.e., anyone who needs the ADT can use it in their program
 * A program that uses the ADT is called a "client" of the ADT
 * The client typically instantiates an object of the ADT
 * and invokes the public methods on the ADT object.
 *
 * This assignment is to practice the idea of client to the ADT.
 * Client class is Fibonacci and the client needs to use the List ADT
 * to store fibonacci numbers in the List ADT.
 * So, Fibonacci is going to instantiate an object of List ADT
 * generate fibonacci numbers and add them to the list
 * by invoking the add method provided in the List ADT.
